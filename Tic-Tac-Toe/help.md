# Tic-Tac-Toe Help

## To play the game, follow these steps:

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 board.
2. Each player takes turns to make a move.
3. On your turn, you will be prompted to enter the coordinates of your move.
    - The coordinates should be entered as numbers i.e 1 1 or 1 2.
    - Rows and columns are in format of a 3 x 3 grid, so valid coordinates range from (1, 1) to (3, 3).
4. After each move, the updated board will be displayed.
5. The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
6. The winner is determined by having three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
7. If the game ends in a draw, it means all positions on the board are filled and no player has won.

## How input relates to grid:


`Below is a visual representation of the 3 x 3 grid in relation to player's input`
    
       -----+-----+-------
       | 1 1 | 1 2 | 1 3 |
       ------+-----+------
       | 2 1 | 2 2 | 2 3 |
       ------+-----+------
       | 3 1 | 3 2 | 3 3 |
       ------+-----+------

Example: A move of 2 2, playing as 'X' becomes:

        ----+-----+----
        1 1 | 1 2 | 1 3 
        ----+-----+----
        2 1 |  X  | 2 3 
        ----+-----+----
        3 1 | 3 2 | 3 3
        ----+-----+----
